Hello,

I am Mattchief4234. 

I am a artist at heart who loves computers. This love drove me to make/assemble my own computer several times and soon this grew to be an
obssession with computers.

Learning about all the different parts of a computer, learning the roles of not only the physical parts but also learning about all the programs
and the coding that goes on behind those programs. 

I am eager to learn about coding and I want to further my understanding of coding and computers in general for myself
and the community as a whole.
